# CowsAndBulls
 
The game involves guessing a mystery 4 digit number. The number contains no repeat digits and no
zero.

With each guess, the number of correct digits – bulls – and the number of digits that would be
correct if they were in the right position – cows.

Example: If the mystery number is 8657 and the player guesses 4678, there is one bull (6), and
two cows (7, 8).
